# Console-Finances

##Overview
I am tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. You have been provided with a financial dataset in the `starter/index.js` file. 

##Acceptance criteria
write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis 
  ----------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average Change: -2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

Your final code should print the analysis to the console.
